		I'm an SAP consultant and occasional ABAP developer with a focus on the management accounting (CO) and project system (PS) modules. SAP has been my passion since university, such that it was the focus of my <a href="Anwendungsprogrammierung_in_SAP_R-3.pdf">bachelor's thesis (German)</a>, and I have worked in this domain for and with several consulting houses and clients over the last 6+ years. Take a look at my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> for further details.
		<p>
		I also do some Python development as a hobby. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/buluto?tab=repositories">browse my repository</a> - maybe you'll find something interesting.
